# OT2-Net

The purpose of this project is (1) to implement webcam livestreaming of OpenTrons bots, (2) to enable remote control/access of OT2 bots through VPN into the OT2 bot's local wifi network, and (3) in the long run, scale this implementation to a network of OT2 bots to allow people to request and run protocols on whichever bot is free/unoccupied at the time

Here are the services an individual OT-Net node should hopefully be able to provide:
  1. Plasmid purification
  2. Restriction enzyme digestion, particularly GoldenGate/MoClo assembly
  3. Plasmid transformation
  4. Colony counting
  5. Colony picking and transfer to fresh plates/cultures
  6. Starting overnight growth cultures, preferably in deep 96-well plates
