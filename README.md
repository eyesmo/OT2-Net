# OT2-Net

#The purpose of this project is (1) to implement webcam livestreaming of OpenTrons bots, (2) to enable remote control/access of OT2 bots through VPN into the OT2 bot's local wifi network, and (3) in the long run, scale this implementation to a network of OT2 bots to allow people to request and run protocols on whichever bot is free/unoccupied at the time
